//! HTTP protocol.
//!
//! Rwf comes with its own implementation, including routing of requests,
//! and a tokio-based async server that can handle millions of
//! concurrent connections.
//!
//! ##### Support for HTTP/2
//! Currently, only HTTP/1.1 is supported. Support for HTTP/2 is a work in progress.
//! You can put the Rwf application behind a load balancer (like nginx) that supports
//! HTTP/2 to take advantage of its performance enhancements.
