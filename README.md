## Quick start

To add Rwf to your stack, create a Rust binary application and add `rwf` and `tokio` to your dependencies:

```bash
cargo add rwf
cargo add tokio@1 --features full
```

Building an app is then as simple as:

```rust
use rwf::prelude::*;
use rwf::http::Server;

#[derive(Default)]
struct IndexController;

#[async_trait]
impl Controller for IndexController {
    async fn handle(&self, request: &Request) -> Result<Response, Error> {
        Ok(Response::new().html("<h1>Hey Rwf!</h1>"))
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    Server::new(vec![
        route!("/" => IndexController),
    ])
    .launch("0.0.0.0:8000")
    .await
    .unwrap();
}
```

## Examples

See [examples](https://github.com/levkk/rwf/tree/main/examples) for common use cases.
