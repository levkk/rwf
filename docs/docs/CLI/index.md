# CLI overview

Rwf comes with its own command-line interface (CLI) to help with local development, and with releasing Rwf-powered apps to production.

## Install the CLI

The CLI is another Rust application, which can be installed with cargo:

```bash
cargo install rwf-cli
```

Once installed, you can run the Rwf CLI from any Rust project.
